The opening paragraph is polite but lacks a compelling hook about why Oracle specifically or what excites you about their cloud and microservices environment. The middle paragraph highlights your academic work in Java, Python, and API development, yet it omits key technologies called out in the posting (C, C++, Rust, Linux, Bash scripting, distributed systems) and doesn’t demonstrate direct experience with scalable microservice architectures in a production context. The closing reiterates your Army leadership background effectively, but misses an opportunity to tie your discipline and teamwork to Oracle’s values of integrity and innovation. To improve: reference Oracle’s products or culture, call out experiences in C/C++/Rust and Linux environments, give a concrete example of collaborating on a microservices project, and craft a stronger, more engaging opening that demonstrates your research into Oracle’s mission.

With a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Washington Tacoma, and a 3.9 cumulative GPA, I am eager to apply my strong technical skills and passion for creating innovative software solutions to this role. My experience in designing and developing applications, combined with my collaborative nature and leadership experience, make me a strong candidate for this position.\n",

       "During my academic career, I have honed my skills in Java, Python, and RESTful API development through several projects, including building a machine learning model to predict user demographics and creating an asymmetric encryption application. As a team leader, I have effectively managed projects to completion, ensuring software quality and integrity. Furthermore, my background in scripting languages like Python and exposure to scalable microservice architecture and distributed systems will enable me to contribute effectively to Oracle's software engineering division. My coursework and projects have equipped me with a solid foundation in software architecture and debugging, aligning well with the responsibilities outlined in the job description.\n",
       "\n",
       "Additionally, my experience in the US Army Reserves as a sergeant has instilled in me strong discipline, leadership, and teamwork skills. These skills, coupled with my technical expertise developed through both academic projects and my role as a team leader on a variety of software endeavors, position me to excel in building enhancements within existing software architectures at Oracle. I am excited by the opportunity to work with such a renowned organization and contribute to meaningful projects that align with Oracle’s commitment to integrity and innovation. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to the success of Oracle.\n",

       "        ## Reason for rejection:\n",
       "The cover letter is well-structured and professional in tone, but it reads like a generic template rather than a targeted Oracle application. The opening paragraph is polite but lacks a compelling hook about why Oracle specifically or what excites you about their cloud and microservices environment. The middle paragraph highlights your academic work in Java, Python, and API development, yet it omits key technologies called out in the posting (C, C++, Rust, Linux, Bash scripting, distributed systems) and doesn’t demonstrate direct experience with scalable microservice architectures in a production context. The closing reiterates your Army leadership background effectively, but misses an opportunity to tie your discipline and teamwork to Oracle’s values of integrity and innovation. To improve: reference Oracle’s products or culture, call out experiences in C/C++/Rust and Linux environments, give a concrete example of collaborating on a microservices project, and craft a stronger, more engaging opening that demonstrates your research into Oracle’s mission. \n",
