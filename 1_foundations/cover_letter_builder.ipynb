For instance, I led a team to create a full-stack web application for managing a book catalog, where I took responsibility for designing a RESTful API backend and navigating complex problems through teamwork and communication. This project honed my skills in Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, while also providing me with hands-on experience in maintaining project standards and ensuring code quality through testing.\n",
