       "While your cover letter follows the three-paragraph structure and avoids extra formatting, it reads as somewhat generic and misses opportunities to really showcase why you and WireWheel are such a great fit. Your opening could be stronger by calling out a particular WireWheel product or challenge that excites you. In the body, you note your experience leading API development and writing testing frameworks, but you don’t give concrete examples of automated test cases you’ve authored or bugs you’ve uncovered. You also admit to no direct Playwright experience; instead of stating that gap outright, describe how you’ve rapidly learned a similar tool or framework and how that skill will transfer. Finally, tie more of your achievements back to the QA role—mention specific test coverage improvements, CI pipelines you’ve configured, or metrics you improved. By sharpening these details and aligning them more closely with the day-to-day responsibilities at WireWheel, your letter will feel more genuine, targeted, and memorable."
